
===Stuff that needs to get done===
  * Archons roughly computing the number of units they have spawned.
    * Either via timeout or backdecay.
  * Fix all State machine errors
  * Small optimizations in broadcasting
  * Chainer code
  * Movement and Attack Micro
  * Archon Memory between Jihad and nonJihad
  * Archon General Strategy (Battle Micro, radioing stuff)
  
  
  
  
  
  Wout Code
  * Head to flux maximum
  * Wout battle strategy
  
  
  
  Integration of all pieces
  
  
  
  
  Cory Notes
  * Test and fix "TargetHit"
  * Movement Data Overflow (36)
  * Bytecode Usage optimizations
  
  
 
 
==General notes=== 
  *To build the project
    * "ant -Dteam=team001 -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 jar"
  
  
Higher Strategy to think about:
 * determine whether there is lots of open space for large hulls or whether
 there are lots of obstructions (to determine tower building restrictions)
