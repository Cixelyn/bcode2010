Future Strategy stuff todo later if we have time

While rushing and looking for enemy, scan map for possible build locations to go back to for hull



Build Code that i Run as of now:
RobotPlayer - all wouts are buildStrategy wouts to bypass transfering flux to archon
			- if default, then we need some msg from archon to tell wouts to become build wouts 
					(waste of time/we can't implement this well at the moment)
ArchonDefaultStrategy - change ArchonBuilderStrategy to NewArchonBuilderStrategy - new trigger for build mode
Wouts - have new condition to spawn tower if not near any other tower and have 5000 flux

i played on plains against basic player and have uber hull
